deeworlds: an attempt to bring the teeworlds concepts to 3D

It is under development so don't expect anything yet.

Building:
	'redo' is used to handle the building but requires a POSIX environment.
	See 'https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/', 'https://github.com/apenwarr/redo',
	'http://www.goredo.cypherpunks.ru/', 'https://github.com/leahneukirchen/redo-c'.
	Currently, I would recommended goredo.

	Also you'll need the GLFW headers and a compiled library
	to link to.

	There are two modes of building: debug and optimized.
	To set the building mode to 'debug' run:
		make debug
	To set the building mode to 'optimized' run:
		make opt
	or
		make optimized
	then run
		make
	to actually build.

	You can use:
		make run
	to run the executable.

Configuration:
	'config.sh' contains the flags that are passed to the compiler and linker.
	You can adjust them to fit your needs. See also:
	'src/inputConfig.h' contains actions to be taken at given input.
	'src/deeworldsConfig.h'

About the LICENSE:
	As far as I am concerned, I'd like to use a public domain licence,
	but I need to contact the 'teeworlds' guys sometime.

You can contact me via github if you have something to ask, etc...

Contributions are welcome, but notice the coding style:

Coding style:
	Unless otherwise nesseccary, (e.g. anonymous struct/unions, etc...)
	we'd rather stick to C99, otherwise we may use certain features of C11.
	Most pricniples are inpsired from 'https://suckless.org/coding_style/'.
	In addition, static variables are prefixed with 's', global with 'g',
	static functions have their prototype at the beginning of the file and
	non-static functions follow static functions' implementatations.
	You can also use the surrounding code for reference.
